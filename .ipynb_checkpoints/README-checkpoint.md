---
There are 2 notebooks :
- `app_PyTorch.ipynb` : this notebook is a POC of watch movement image classifier. The model is based on ResNet152 with fastai librairy (PyTorch). This beta version model can be tested here : https://huggingface.co/spaces/gpenessot/watch_movement_detector
- `app_TensorFlow.ipynb` : this notebooks is a classification model based on VGG16. The aim of this notebook is to explore model results by extracting features map and Grad-CAM
